    <h3>Goods subject to availability</h3>


    <p>All goods displayed on our website are subject to availability. If any goods you ordered are not immediately available or are not available at all, we will let you know as soon as possible. Goods are only available for delivery in Zambia.</p>


    <h3>Price and Display</h3>



    <p>The stated prices on our website are in Zambian Kwacha and are only valid and effective in Zambia.
Display: We will use our best efforts to accurately display the goods, specifically regarding their colour, description and price. Please remember however that the way you see the goods is also dependent on the device that you are using to access our websites or apps. We cannot guarantee that the goods you receive will look exactly as you have seen it
</p>


    <h3>Order completion and cancellation</h3>

    <p>We will indicate the acceptance of your order by delivering the goods to you, or allowing you to collect it. Only at that point will your order be complete and an agreement of sale between you and us come into effect (the "Sale"). This is regardless of any communication from us stating that your order or payment has been confirmed. We will indicate the rejection of your order by cancelling it and, as soon as possible thereafter, refunding you for any amounts already paid. Adding goods to a wish list or placing it in an online shopping cart/bag without completing the purchase process ("checking out") does not constitute a valid order, so we may remove the goods from your online bag/cart if stock is no longer available and change the price of the goods without notice to you. You cannot hold us or any third party seller liable if the goods are no longer available, or the price has changed when you check out or try to check out at a later stage.</p>
    <p>Order cancellation by us: We reserve the right to not process an order or to cancel an existing order (partially or completely):
•	If you have gone under debt review before your order is fulfilled;
•	If, on our website, we suspect that you have, or have tried to: abuse the website; intercept data; commit fraud; hack into our systems; or create multiple user profiles to take advantage of a promotion or other offer intended by us to be used once-off by you. We will also be entitled to blacklist you on our database, delete your profile and suspend or terminate your access to our websites and apps (in which case we accept no liability which may arise); and
•	If there has been an error. Errors include system errors, the goods no longer being available, incorrect price, quantity or description of the goods. We will not be bound by errors and we will inform you of such errors as soon as we become aware of them.
If cancellation of an order is initiated by us, no cancellation fees will be payable. We will refund you the Kwacha value that you have paid, only if you have already paid for the cancelled order. We will not be liable for any loss or claim relating to a cancelled order or refusal to process an order. We are not bound by any incorrect information about goods that are on our third party providers' website.
