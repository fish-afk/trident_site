        <p>Delivery fee
We will charge a delivery fee for every order you place, which will be quoted and billed at checkout. The delivery options presented to you in checkout are dependent on your cart contents and delivery address.
Additional delivery charges
Additional delivery charges (which will vary, depending on your delivery address) may apply to outlying areas, as well as the delivery of furniture. Delivery fees may change at any time without notice to you. The delivery fee and any additional charges applicable to your order will be communicated to you and must be paid when you place an order.

Delivery
We will arrange for delivery to the delivery address that you provided to us in checkout. We are not responsible for any loss or unauthorized use of the goods once we have delivered the goods to the delivery address you have provided to us.
Our couriers deliver between 09h00 and 17h00 on weekdays (Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays) and we only deliver within Zambia. Our ability to deliver is also always subject to certain factors, including the availability of the goods and the supply of accurate delivery address details.
Delivery period
We will always do what is reasonably possible (but cannot guarantee that we will be able) to ensure that delivery happens within the approximate timelines indicated at checkout. If there are any delivery-related problems that cause unreasonable delays, you may refuse to accept delivery and we will refund you the Kwacha  value that you have paid. We will try to deliver all the goods in your order at the same time, but goods may be sourced from multiple stores or fulfillment centre’s and may arrive in multiple packages. 


IF YOU WANT TO CANCEL YOUR ORDER
You may only cancel your order before it has been paid. You can find your order by simply typing in the email or cell number you used when you placed the order, and your order number, into the form at the bottom of the site. We can only process refunds once we have confirmed that the goods have been returned to our distribution centre’s. If you want to cancel the order after payment was made, or return the goods after delivery or collection, it will be subject to our returns policy. Please refer to the Special Orders tab for terms and conditions that apply to personalized and special order goods. Please contact our Customer Services at 0762069682 if you have any queries regarding cancellation.
